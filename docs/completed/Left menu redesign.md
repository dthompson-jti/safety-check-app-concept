Phase 3 (Deferred): Left Menu & Settings Redesign
Note: As requested, this phase is separated for future consideration. The following is the current plan for this work, which can be updated based on your further review.
1. Settings Page Redesign
Requirement: Replace the current full-screen modal for Settings with a more modern, accessible, and informationally flat flyover panel.
Options Analysis:
Option A: Standard Side Panel (Flyover): A conventional and easy-to-implement pattern, but can feel generic.
Option B: Interactive Bottom Sheet (Mobile-First): On mobile, a sheet slides up from the bottom—a more ergonomic and native-feeling interaction. It can be dismissed by dragging it down. On larger screens, it can adapt into a side panel. This demonstrates a higher level of craft and aligns perfectly with the project's "Mobile-First" principle.
Option C: "Peek-a-Boo" Panel with Staggered Content: A visually polished but potentially distracting animation pattern.
Recommendation: Option B (Interactive Bottom Sheet) is the recommended path. It provides the best mobile-first UX and the highest degree of craft. The flat information architecture (App Title, History Link, etc., ending with Logout) will be implemented as a single, scrollable list within this new panel component.
