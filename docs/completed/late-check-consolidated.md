# Late Check: Consolidated Concepts & Strategy

This document consolidates the final output of the research phase, organized into the **7 Winning Primitives**, the **Morphological System**, and the **10 Strategic Remixes**.

## 1. The 7 Winning Primitives
These are the highest-scoring individual concepts from the initial research (Round 1-4).

| ID | Concept | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#23** | **Team Heatmap Mini-map** | *Utility* | Right-edge visual density ticks showing where late checks are in the list. |
| **#12** | **Jump FAB** | *Navigation* | Floating pill button that appears only when late items are off-screen. |
| **#1** | **Ambient Pulse** | *Signal* | Continuous "breathing" animation on the card border/glow. |
| **#4** | **Urgency Gradient** | *texture* | Animated mesh gradient background for late cards. |
| **#13** | **Dynamic Typography** | *Emphasis* | Font weight increases (Bold/Black) based on lateness. |
| **#11** | **Edge Vignette** | *Atmosphere* | Red glow creeping in from the screen corners. |
| **#5** | **Tab Badge** | *Notification* | Standard system red dot on the tab bar. |

## 2. Morphological Chart (The Atoms)
We deconstructed the winners into their atomic dimensions to allow for systematic remixing.

| Source Concept | **Location** | **Trigger** | **Visual** | **Interaction** | **Metaphor** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mini-map** | Viewport Edge | Scroll Pos | Geometry (Tick) | Navigation (Jump) | Data (Radar) |
| **Jump FAB** | Overlay (Bottom) | Off-screen | Motion (Slide) | Action (Click) | Signage |
| **Ambient Pulse** | Card Border | Time Loop | Opacity/Glow | Passive | Biology (Living) |
| **Gradient** | Card Background | Static | Color Mesh | Passive | Environment |
| **Dynamic Type** | Text Layer | Static | Font Weight | Passive | Data (Emphasis) |
| **Vignette** | Full Screen Edge | Global State | Red Glow | Passive | Atmosphere |
| **Badge** | Tab Bar | Status Change | Shape (Dot) | Passive | Notification |

## 3. The 10 Strategic Remixes
By combining atoms from the chart above, we generated 10 high-value hybrid concepts.

### **The Power Trio (Recommended)**

#### **#51 The Pulse-Map** (Mini-map + Pulse)
*   **Formula**: `Mini-map (Location)` + `Pulse (Visual)`
*   **Description**: The Mini-map ticks on the right edge *pulse* with the same breathing rhythm as the card itself.
*   **Why**: Makes the "Radar" feel alive and actionable.

#### **#55 Living Background** (Vignette + Gradient)
*   **Formula**: `Vignette (Role)` + `Gradient (Visual)`
*   **Description**: Instead of a generic red glow, the *Urgency Gradient* mesh becomes the global background texture when critical checks exist.
*   **Why**: Creates a cohesive, high-craft atmosphere.

#### **#56 Haptic Ticks** (Mini-map + Haptic Road Bump)
*   **Formula**: `Mini-map (Location)` + `Haptic (Feedback)`
*   **Description**: Dragging your finger along the Mini-map area triggers haptic clicks corresponding to the ticks, allowing you to "feel" the list density.
*   **Why**: Adds a tactile dimension to the data visualization.

### **The Experimental Set**

#### **#52 Gradient Navigation** (FAB + Gradient)
*   **Description**: The "Jump to Late" FAB is filled with the animated *Urgency Gradient* instead of a solid color.

#### **#53 Typographic Vignette** (Vignette + Type)
*   **Description**: Large, bold "15m" timers bleed onto the screen edges, using text as an atmospheric texture.

#### **#54 Scroll-to-Wake** (Pulse + Scroll Trigger)
*   **Description**: Cards are static until you scroll; the kinetic energy of scrolling "wakes up" the Ambient Pulse.

#### **#57 Action Ripple** (FAB + Pulse)
*   **Description**: The Jump FAB emits a sonar ripple when it enters the screen to guarantee eye contact.

#### **#58 Bold Borders** (Border + Type)
*   **Description**: Card border thickness scales mathematically with font weight (e.g., 1px -> 4px) as urgency increases.

#### **#59 The Red Lens** (Badge + Motion)
*   **Description**: The Tab Badge detaches and flies to the late card when the view opens.

#### **#60 Atmospheric Type** (Type + Vignette)
*   **Description**: The word "Late" has a glowing text-shadow/bleed, creating a mini-vignette around the text itself.
