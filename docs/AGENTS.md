# Safety Check App: PWA Prototype

This project is a high-craft prototype for a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for the eSupervision Safety Check workflow. It is built upon a robust foundation of modern web technologies and a professional-grade styling architecture to facilitate rapid design and interaction testing.

## 1. Core Principles

-   **Mobile-First Design:** Layouts, components, and interactions are designed for touch-based devices first, then gracefully enhanced for larger screens.
-   **High-Craft UI:** All interactions are designed to be smooth, intuitive, and visually polished, leveraging performant animations and a consistent design language.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is composed of small, reusable, and accessible components built on top of Radix UI primitives.
-   **Atomic State Management:** Global state is managed with Jotai, ensuring a minimal, performant, and predictable state layer.
-   **Rapid Design Prototyping:** The application is built to test and validate multiple UX patterns quickly. Key features, like the main layout, are toggleable to allow for direct comparison.
