# Plan Workflow

Create an implementation plan for a medium feature.

## Scale Evaluator

Before proceeding, evaluate scope:
- If ≤30 lines and ≤5 files → consider `/quick-fix` instead
- If larger or requires design decisions → continue with this workflow

## Steps

1. **Discovery**: Understand the feature and its impact.
2. **Options**: Generate 3-4 approaches with brief evaluation.
3. **Design**: Document file changes and phased implementation.
4. **Review**: Request user approval before proceeding to build.

## Artifacts Produced
- `implementation_plan.md` artifact
- `task.md` artifact

## Notes
- Uses the `plan/feature` skill
- After approval, proceed to `/build`
