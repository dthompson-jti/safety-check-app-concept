# PRD Workflow

Create a comprehensive PRD for a large feature.

## Steps

1. **Discovery**: Clarify the user problem and scope.
2. **Design Options**: Generate 4-6 distinct approaches using forced diversity.
3. **Specification**: Document state matrix, user flows, ASCII wireframes, accessibility requirements.
4. **Validation**: Identify UX risks and define done criteria.
5. **Review**: Request user approval before proceeding to architecture.

## Artifacts Produced
- `PRD-[EPIC-NAME].md` in `docs/working/`
- `implementation_plan.md` artifact
- `task.md` artifact

## Notes
- Uses the `plan/prd` skill
- After approval, proceed to `/architect`
