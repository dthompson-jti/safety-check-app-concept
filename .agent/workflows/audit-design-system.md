# Audit Design System Workflow

Review design system adherence.

## Steps

1. **Project Invariants**: Check `docs/knowledge-base/SPEC-*.md` and `RULES-*.md` for design system constraints.

2. **Target**: Identify scope.

3. **Audit**: Check color tokens, component usage, theming, semantic tokens per the `audit/design-system` skill.

4. **Report**: Document findings with token references.

## Suggested Next Steps

Review findings above. When ready:
- `/quick-fix` — for atomic fixes (≤30 lines, ≤5 files)
- `/plan` — for larger remediation efforts

## Artifacts Produced
- Findings report

## Notes
- Uses the `audit/design-system` skill
- References SPEC-CSS.md, SPEC-SPACING.md
