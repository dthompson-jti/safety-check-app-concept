# Architect Workflow

Create technical architecture for a large feature.

## Steps

1. **Requirement Mapping**: Map PRD to architectural components.
2. **Options Evaluation**: Evaluate 3-4 architectural approaches.
3. **Specification**: Document data flow, data model, component hierarchy, state management, file manifest.
4. **Risk Analysis**: Hostile review for failure modes.
5. **Review**: Request user approval before proceeding to build.

## Artifacts Produced
- `implementation_plan.md` artifact (detailed)
- `task.md` artifact

## Notes
- Uses the `plan/architecture` skill
- After approval, proceed to `/build`
