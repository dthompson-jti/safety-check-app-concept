# Audit Typography Workflow

Review typography consistency.

## Steps

1. **Project Invariants**: Check `docs/knowledge-base/SPEC-*.md` and `RULES-*.md` for typography-specific constraints (e.g., weight limits, font mandates).

2. **Target**: Identify scope.

3. **Audit**: Check font sizes, weights, line heights, hierarchy per the `audit/typography` skill.

4. **Report**: Document findings with file:line citations.

## Suggested Next Steps

Review findings above. When ready:
- `/quick-fix` — for atomic fixes (≤30 lines, ≤5 files)
- `/plan` — for larger remediation efforts

## Artifacts Produced
- Findings report

## Notes
- Uses the `audit/typography` skill
