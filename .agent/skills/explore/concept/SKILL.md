# Explore Concept

Broad ideation and problem definition using Socratic questioning.

## When to Use
- Early-stage exploration
- Problem isn't well-defined
- Need to generate divergent ideas
- Clarifying requirements

## Approach

### Phase 1: Socratic Discovery
Ask 3-5 probing questions:
- What problem are we really solving?
- Who benefits and how?
- What does success look like?
- What constraints exist?

Reject vague answers — push for specificity.

### Phase 2: Divergent Ideation
Generate **10 divergent concepts** without constraints, then select top 3.

For each:
- Core idea
- Key benefit
- Biggest risk

### Phase 3: Synthesis
Narrow to 1-2 directions worth exploring further.

## Constraints
- No code or implementation plans
- No premature convergence
- End with: "Which of these directions feels most aligned with our goals?"
