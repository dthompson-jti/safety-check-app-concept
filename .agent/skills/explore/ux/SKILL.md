# Explore UX

Explore interaction design, user flows, and information architecture.

## When to Use
- Designing new user interactions
- Planning information architecture
- Exploring navigation patterns
- Considering accessibility implications

## Approach

### Phase 1: User Context
Clarify:
- Who is the user?
- What task are they trying to accomplish?
- What's their mental model?

### Phase 2: Flow Exploration
Generate **3-4 distinct interaction patterns** considering:
- Number of steps/clicks
- Cognitive load
- Discoverability
- Accessibility

### Phase 3: Recommendation
Recommend an approach with:
- Primary user flow (step-by-step)
- Edge cases to consider
- Accessibility requirements

## Constraints
- No technical architecture — that's `explore/tech`
- No visual design — that's `explore/ui-design`
- Focus on interaction, not implementation
