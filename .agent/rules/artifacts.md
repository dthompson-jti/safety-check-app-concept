# Artifacts Rule

Use the standard Antigravity artifacts to track work.

## Core Artifacts

### `task.md`
- Update via `task_boundary` tool
- Track progress on complex tasks
- Use markdown checklists

### `implementation_plan.md`
- Create during PLANNING mode
- Document proposed changes
- Request user approval before implementation

### `walkthrough.md`
- Create during VERIFICATION mode
- Document changes made
- Include testing results
- Provide context rehydration for future sessions

## Best Practices
- Keep artifacts concise
- Update `task.md` throughout work
- Create `implementation_plan.md` before major changes
- Create `walkthrough.md` after completing work
