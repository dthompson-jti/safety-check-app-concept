# Browser Usage Rule

Do **NOT** use the browser for testing unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Rationale
The user prefers to test manually in the browser and provide feedback directly. Agent-driven browser testing is disruptive to this workflow.

## When Browser IS Allowed
- User explicitly says "test in browser" or "verify in browser"
- User asks for a screenshot or recording
- User asks to demonstrate functionality

## Default Behavior
After implementation, STOP and ask:
> "Implementation complete. Please review in browser and let me know if any adjustments are needed."
